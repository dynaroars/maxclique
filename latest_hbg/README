Jul21.bk !

*this*
- Contains updates to parallelizing the localoptimization part, not to improve speed to hopefully can improve results, mainly to make processor not idling.
- Dr. Bui suggests to do quitting criteria (e.g if after # of stages and no help, stop)
- Dr. Bui suggests to see if instead of taking top 20%,  take 20% PROPORTIONALLY (should be easy,  i.e.g find the best, based on rand()<80 , then do it , else skip to next
- Try to increase the factor * numAnts score then use numAnts--
- Try to increase # of ants , jack up stuffs change params and see if can match Rizzo's ones on san200*
- Investigate on if AntShufflings helped Rizzo's on san200
- SEe if can put gorClique in parallelizing, so that each processor choose a different one to grow
- Try to mangling up the Initial Greedy Clique
- Try on different graphs (DIMACS) , big ones , to see the speedup 
* CLEAN UP the mVertices = new ()
- discovered a bug (converting int to double etc)
- try take out the   /(ANT_VER_EDGE*AntMultipler*5) etc, idea is to make the numberAnts and pheromone to be distinguished, otherwise it's too small.  NO, don't do this, doing this will make it max out at MAX_SCORE.  think of other methods

>  got a 57  here,  great improvement ../../scripts/rf.out t//1121882879/san200_0.9_2.clq.b.log




---------------


Remove NumAnts--  ,  everything else should be the same as Jun26_2ndOMP 


Some added parts after Jun26

- Put 2 openmp parallel loop (disableBacktracing) into one main one
- Added RIZZO flag so can compare on the fly differences between 2 models

Jul12

- Main part added was testing to see the difference in pheromone (TEST_EDGES flag) in two type of runs on random edges


Jul13
- Added OMP for SetScore   , flag PSCORE




-------
FLAG
PSCORE :  OMP for setScore
PEDGESCAN: OMP for edgeScan in ants operations
PLOCAL: OMP for local 
RIZZO: using Rizzo's ant movements

icpc  main.cc  -o out/par.r  -openmp -DTEST_EDGES -DRIZZO -DD1
icpc  main.cc  -o out/par.t  -openmp -DTEST_EDGES  -DD1   #note that D1 is the flag to run on random number output
